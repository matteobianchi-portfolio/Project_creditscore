# Credit Score Project 
This project aims to identify the best machine learning model for predicting a person's credit score based on a set of features. The analysis is based on two large datasets downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification). 
The main objective was to explore effective strategies for handling missing values and "dirty" data.
